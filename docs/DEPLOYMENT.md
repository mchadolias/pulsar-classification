## Web Deployment Fly.io 

![Flyio App](../outputs/screenshot/flyio_app.png)

The Pulsar Star Classification API has been successfully deployed and tested in production environments. The application was deployed to fly.io and demonstrated full functionality including:

- ✅ Real-time pulsar star predictions via REST API
- ✅ Interactive Swagger documentation at /docs endpoint
- ✅ Health monitoring endpoints
- ✅ Scalable containerized deployment

Deployment Proof: The API was fully operational on fly.io with live endpoints serving predictions. Screenshots captured during deployment confirm all features working as expected, including the model serving accurate classifications with >92% precision.

![Flyio App Deployment](../outputs/screenshot/flyio_deployment.png)

**Note:** For a limited time the application will be available to the aforementioned hostname: `https://pulsar-classification.fly.dev`

**Note:** While the fly.io deployment has been taken down to manage infrastructure costs, the successful deployment demonstrated the API's production readiness and scalability principles. The containerized application can be easily redeployed to any cloud platform supporting Docker containers.

## Hugging Face Spaces

Another way to deploy the app to Hugging Face has been implemented. Where you can see the final outcome of my deployed app at [mchadolias/pulsar-classification-htru2](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mchadolias/pulsar-classification-htru2/)

Requirements for this method is to have an already set-up hugging face account. If you have any question regarding, how to set up your account check up this [guide](https://medium.com/@kirubasagar82/a-comprehensive-guide-to-creating-a-hugging-face-account-and-navigating-the-interface-d4796148b76f).

```bash
# Deploy to Hugging Face
cd deployment
./deploy_hf.sh
```

## 🐍 Python Client Usage

#### Single Prediction

```python
python client.py
```

#### Batch Prediction  

```python
python client.py --batch
```

### Interpretation Guide

#### Probability Thresholds

- **≥ 0.5**: Classified as pulsar (`"is_pulsar": true`)
- **< 0.5**: Classified as non-pulsar (`"is_pulsar": false`)

#### Confidence Levels

- **0.9-1.0**: High confidence pulsar
- **0.7-0.9**: Moderate confidence pulsar  
- **0.5-0.7**: Low confidence pulsar
- **0.3-0.5**: Possible non-pulsar
- **0.0-0.3**: High confidence non-pulsar
